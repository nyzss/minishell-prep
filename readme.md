# minishell prepping

functional minishell, but the catch is that NO error whatsoever is handled, nearly no memory is freed and obviously file descriptors are wide open. The goal is to have a playground to experiment and see what method I should go with, what to do and not do. I have been able to get quite a been of knowledge and experience with the tools and resource I will be using when starting this project again.
